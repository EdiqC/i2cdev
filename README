Pure Python i2c module for the Raspberry Pi.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Install the i2c-bcm2708 kernel module. The newest version of this
   driver is required to perform combined transactions.
   Use 'lsmod' to list modules, 'modprobe' to load modules.
   May need to edit the "/etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf" file.
2. Install the i2c-dev kernel module. This creates the "/dev/i2c-x"
   device files used by this module to access the i2c busses.
3. Run the module and it will show which i2c busses it can access.
4. Run the module with the bus number as a parameter it will will
   perform a scan similar to the "i2cdetect" command.
   Bus 0 is typically used with the camera module on S5.
   Bus 1 is available on the GPIO Connector.
   Bus 2 is not accessible (permanantly wired for HDMI).
